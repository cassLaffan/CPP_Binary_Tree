# CPP_Binary_Tree
This little exercise was to brush up on my C++ skills as well as to relearn the implementation
of binary trees for a coding test; the coding test did not have binary trees on it, so I didn't
get the job, but at least there's a repo on here that proves I can still write (C style) C++
code.
